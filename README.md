# Factorio Map Roller

A small script for rerolling maps and starting Livesplit in Factorio random seed speedruns.

Instead of using a static location for the reroll button it has a simple system to find the button automatically. This allows it to adjust for any UI scale and screen resolution. While also stopping accidentally triggering, and resetting Liveplit, while outside of the map preview.

Has the ability to control Livesplit with either hotkeys or TCP network connection.

## Usage

A hotkey can be any single key or combined with `ctrl`, `alt`, and `shift` keys.

The reroll hotkey defaults to F12, but can be easily changed by clicking on the field and hitting the desired key or key combinations.

After starting the first time be sure to configure the Livesplit control method. 

For keyboard based control just set the two hotkeys used to reset and start Livesplit.

For TCP control enter the IP and port Livesplit is running on. The IP `127.0.0.1` works when Livesplit is working running on the same computer. Also at least currently in version 1.8.29 of Livesplit the TCP server has to be started each time Livesplit is started.
